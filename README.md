# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of data cleaning projects!  
Here, I showcase real-world datasets that I cleaned and prepared for analysis and modeling.

Each project focuses on identifying and fixing issues such as:
- Duplicate entries
- Missing values
- Inconsistent column names
- String-to-number conversions
- Dirty formats (like currency and date)
- Useless or irrelevant columns
